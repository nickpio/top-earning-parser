Players hold a role in the United States Armed Forces, and deploy on operations in Africa.\n\n⚔️ This is a ROLEPLAY-focused game, not a shooter. Weapon damage is LOW to give players time to communicate and move around under fire. This won't be enjoyable for all players.\n\n💀 This game has permadeath! When you die (or leave), someone else in the server claims your role - it won't be there when you come back.\n\n🎖️ Users are promoted automatically when roles above open up. Climb the ranks to become a Platoon Sergeant, Company Commander, or even the General!\n\n🚨 Rules: https://devforum.roblox.com/t/chesapeake-entertainment-rules-info/3880016\n🖥️ Servers: https://www.roblox.com/games/127103820849363/CA-PC\n\nOriginal soundtrack by Nicolas Baquero\n© 2024-2025 Chesapeake International Entertainment S.A.",
